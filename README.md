# CS342 Assignments

**DISCLAIMER:** All the work here has been shared on GitHub to create an archive of materials from the CS342 course. You should not use those codes for your academic studies. Otherwise, you will do nothing but deceive yourself.

This repository consists of my solutions to every single work in Bilkent University CS342 course. During my junior year, I took the course from Prof. Dr. İ. Körpeoğlu in the 2022-2023 Spring Semester.

## Structure

All assignments are organized in the following order:

```txt
Homework/
├── Homework #1/
└── Homework #2/
    ├── ...
    └── Homework2.pdf
Projects/
├── Project 1/
├── Project 2/
├── Project 3/
└── Project 4/
    ├── ...
    ├── README.txt
    └── project4.pdf
```

The corresponding instructions for every assignment can be found in the ``<assignment_name>.pdf`` file in their own folder.
